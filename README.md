# Web Applications
This repository encompasses the weekly work developed for the Web Applications course, which aimed to familiarize students with the theoretical knowhow of building a web application akin to Ebay.


#### Team:
- Ana Araújo

- Tiago Rodrigues

#### Professor: 
- Pedro Antunes


## Application
In this course, the application to design was an Ebay killer with a focus on online auctions. The app had to meet the following criteria:
- Data requirements: Items, auctions and bids
- Users: Sellers and bidders
- System requirements: NoSQL, responsive, single page app, works on phones or computers

The actual app development was not the focus of the course, only building the its blueprint.

## First week - Back-end Handlers
The goal of the first week was to think about all the microservices needed for the app, compile them in a document and providing all the requests that each microservice allows in a RESTful format.


## Second week - Formulation of Back-end Handlers using Swagger
The goal of the second week was to convert the work of the first week to JSON using the Swagger platform. This required the indication of which data is required for a given operation and what the ouput of a given operation was.

  
## Third week - Workflow design
The goal of the third week was to design several workflows, which are distinct ways a user can interact with the app and which services and operations are called in a given workflow.



## Fourth week - Business objects
The goal of the fourth week was to evaluate which of the developed microservices can be considered value streams and from here define the business objects of the app using a JSON schema.
